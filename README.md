## Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer with expertise in application development, solution consulting and SAAS sales. I love to build things and have a deep appreciation for elegant solutions and beautiful design. At hackathons and conferences, I have been able to pursue my passion for sharing knowledge with others. I am all about learning and discovering new things.
Over my carreer in IT, I have enjoyed collaborating with wonderful people from different backgrounds and cultures. And I have worked with a variety of back-end and front-end technologies.

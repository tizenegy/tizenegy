## Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Product Manager with 12+ years of experience in 
- product management
- application development 
- solution consulting

I love to build things and have a deep appreciation for elegant solutions and beautiful design. At hackathons and conferences, I have been able to pursue my passion for sharing knowledge with others. I am all about learning and discovering new things.

Over my carreer in IT, I have enjoyed collaborating with wonderful people from different backgrounds and cultures. And I have worked with a variety of back-end and front-end technologies.

I am a digital nomad open for projects all over Europe and the world.
